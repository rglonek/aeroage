# Is it a new car?

## Overview

This repository hosts advanced philosophical logic processing code designed to tackle a timeless question: If you take just the frame of an old car (along with its VIN) and replace all other parts with new components, is it still the old car, or does it become a new car with an old VIN and frame?

The code utilizes cutting-edge LLM (Logic and Language Model) processing, incorporating neural pathways scanned from actual brains, combined with an inherent understanding of The Life, Universe, and Everything.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to explore and attempt to answer the philosophical quandary posed above. By running the provided code, users can engage in an exercise that transcends conventional human reasoning. The code aims to produce an answer that defies typical human intuition and provides a new perspective on the age-old question.

## Why Philosophy Curriculum Should Take Note

Given the code's ability to tackle this perennial philosophical problem, it calls into question the necessity of teaching this topic in traditional philosophy courses worldwide. The code's conclusions challenge conventional wisdom and present a compelling case for reconsidering the inclusion of this question in educational curricula.

## Usage

You can run the code yourself by downloading the repository and executing it with golang. Alternatively, you can experience the code in action using the [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/V0u1bjXFte1).
