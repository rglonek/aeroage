# Is it a new car

Question: if take just the frame of an old car (and it's VIN) and replace everything else with new parts, is it still the old car, or is it a new car with an old VIN and frame?

This repository contains advanced philosophical logic processing code, based on LLM processing and brain-scanned neurological pathways, together with built-in understanding of The Life, Universe and Everything.

The code may be run to answer the above question. After processing the logic involved in solving the unsolvable, it will produce the answer no human could.

As the code is able to answer this, phylosophy lessons around the globe should remove the question from their curriculum.

You can download and run the code yourself, or you can run it via [go playground](https://go.dev/play/p/V0u1bjXFte1)
